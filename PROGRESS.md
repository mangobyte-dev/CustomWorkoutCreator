# CustomWorkoutCreator - Progress & Checkpoint

## üéØ Project Goal
Create a dead-simple, bare-minimum MVP of a custom workout app that lets users create workouts in the structures they prefer. The app should bend to users' will, not force them into rigid structures.

## üìÖ Last Updated: August 5, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Data Models (DataModels.swift)
- [x] **Flexible workout structure** supporting multiple training styles
- [x] **TrainingMethod enum** with associated values:
  - `.standard(minReps: Int, maxReps: Int)` - Rep ranges for progressive overload
  - `.restPause(targetTotal: Int, minReps: Int, maxReps: Int)` - Calisthenics cluster training with rep ranges
  - `.timed(seconds: Int)` - Duration-based exercises
- [x] **Tempo support** for controlled movements (eccentric-pause-concentric notation)
- [x] **Nested structure**: Workout ‚Üí Intervals ‚Üí Exercises
- [x] **All models are Codable** for save/load functionality
- [x] **Exercise effort level** (1-10 scale) for intensity tracking
- [x] **Rest after interval** property for custom rest blocks between intervals

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Swift Testing framework (modern approach)
- [x] 76% code coverage on initial tests
- [x] Tests covering:
  - Tempo notation edge cases
  - Different workout type creation
  - Codable serialization
  - Default values and empty states

### 3. SwiftData Persistence Layer
- [x] **Converted all models to @Model classes** for SwiftData compatibility
- [x] **TrainingMethod enum** made SwiftData-compatible with custom Codable implementation
- [x] **WorkoutStore created** with @Observable (not ObservableObject) following CLAUDE.md
- [x] **CRUD operations implemented**:
  - `fetchAllWorkouts()` - Sorted by date (newest first)
  - `addWorkout()` - Insert and save
  - `deleteWorkout()` - Delete with cascade
  - `updateWorkout()` - Save changes
- [x] **SwiftData configuration** in app entry point
- [x] **Cascade delete rules** for proper data cleanup

### 4. Base App Structure
- [x] **Tab-based navigation** with 3 tabs (Home, Workouts, Settings)
- [x] **Minimal views** ready for UI implementation
- [x] **App builds and runs** successfully with persistence

### 5. UI Implementation - CREATE (Phase 1 Complete!)

- [x] **NewWorkoutView** with inline editing:
  - Workout name field
  - Add/remove intervals
  - Expandable/collapsible intervals
  - Inline interval name editing
  - Rounds and rest steppers
  - Rest after interval stepper
- [x] **Inline exercise editing**:
  - Exercise name field
  - Effort level (1-10) stepper
  - Segmented control for training method
  - Rep range steppers for standard exercises
  - Rep range for rest-pause
  - Time stepper for timed exercises
  - Swipe to delete exercises
- [x] **Save functionality**:
  - Creates workout with calculated duration
  - Saves to SwiftData
  - Returns to workout list
- [x] **WorkoutsView** showing saved workouts:
  - Empty state with call to action
  - List of workouts with name, intervals, duration
  - Swipe to delete
  - Auto-refresh after creating workout

### 6. Performance Refactoring - Component System (Phase 1 COMPLETE!)
- [x] **Protocol Conformance** for efficient diffing:
  - Hashable, Equatable, and Comparable added to all models
  - Enables efficient SwiftUI view updates
- [x] **ComponentConstants** created:
  - Pre-computed all static values at compile time
  - Cached formatters (NumberFormatter, DateComponentsFormatter)
  - Centralized styling constants
- [x] **Reusable Components Implemented**:
  - **SectionHeader**: Performant section headers with optional trailing content
  - **Row**: Flexible row component with factory methods (LabelRow, FieldRow, ToggleRow, StepperRow, ButtonRow)
  - **Expandable**: Tap-to-expand container with proper list animation support
  - **ActionButton**: Beautiful, animated button component with 5 styles and 3 sizes
  - **ExpandableList**: Generic expandable list manager eliminating 90% boilerplate
  - All components use ViewBuilder for lazy evaluation
  - All components implement Equatable for minimal redraws

### 7. Performance Refactoring - Phase 2 (COMPLETE! ‚úÖ)
- [x] **WorkoutDetailView_New** created as parallel implementation
- [x] **WorkoutDetailViewCache** with pre-computed formatters
- [x] **IntervalCard component** with expandable functionality

  - Uses `case let` syntax as per CLAUDE.md
- [x] **ExpandableList integration** eliminating 90% boilerplate code
- [x] **All CLAUDE.md principles applied**:
  - No closures in view bodies
  - Pre-computed values everywhere
  - @ViewBuilder for conditional content
  - Static lookup tables for icons/colors
  - No runtime calculations
- [x] **Exercise list content implementation** (Step 16)

## üé® Architecture Decisions

1. **Single-screen creation** - No sheets or navigation for workout building
2. **Inline editing everywhere** - Direct manipulation without popups
3. **Rep ranges instead of single values** - Better for progressive overload
4. **Effort tracking** - Simple 1-10 scale for each exercise
5. **Rest after interval** - Clean solution for rest blocks between intervals
6. **No ViewModels** - Following CLAUDE.md guidelines
7. **Vanilla SwiftUI only** - No custom design system for MVP

## üìù Example Usage

```swift
// Standard workout with rep ranges
let pushups = Exercise(
    name: "Push-ups", 
    trainingMethod: .standard(minReps: 12, maxReps: 15),
    effort: 7
)

// Rest-pause with rep ranges
let pullups = Exercise(
    name: "Pull-ups", 
    trainingMethod: .restPause(targetTotal: 50, minReps: 8, maxReps: 12),
    effort: 9
)

// Timed exercise
let plank = Exercise(
    name: "Plank", 
    trainingMethod: .timed(seconds: 60),
    effort: 8
)

// Interval with rest after
let interval = Interval(
    name: "Upper Body",
    exercises: [pushups, pullups],
    rounds: 3,
    restBetweenRounds: 60,
    restAfterInterval: 120  // 2 minute rest before next interval
)
```

### 8. Performance Refactoring - Phase 3 (COMPLETE! ‚úÖ)

## üèÜ Performance Achievements
- Row component corner radius fix ensures proper rendering in all positions
- Expandable component binding change enables smooth list animations
- All components pre-compute values for optimal performance
- Zero runtime closures in view bodies
