# CustomWorkoutCreator - Progress & Checkpoint

## 🎯 Project Goal
Create a dead-simple, bare-minimum MVP of a custom workout app that lets users create workouts in the structures they prefer. The app should bend to users' will, not force them into rigid structures.

## 📅 Last Updated: July 16, 2025

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Data Models (DataModels.swift)
- [x] **Flexible workout structure** supporting multiple training styles
- [x] **TrainingMethod enum** with associated values:
  - `.standard(reps: Int)` - Traditional sets x reps
  - `.restPause(targetTotal: Int, repRange: String?)` - Calisthenics cluster training
  - `.timed(seconds: Int)` - Duration-based exercises
- [x] **Tempo support** for controlled movements (eccentric-pause-concentric notation)
- [x] **Nested structure**: Workout → Intervals → Exercises
- [x] **All models are Codable** for save/load functionality

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Swift Testing framework (modern approach)
- [x] 76% code coverage on initial tests
- [x] Tests covering:
  - Tempo notation edge cases
  - Different workout type creation
  - Codable serialization
  - Default values and empty states

## 🚧 Current State

### What's Working
- Data models compile and pass all tests
- Flexible enough to handle user's example: "1 circuit of pushups and dips for 4 rounds, then step ups for 5 rounds, then glute bridges for 5 rounds"
- Test infrastructure is set up and running

### What's Missing
- No UI implementation yet
- No persistence layer
- No workout timer/tracking
- No exercise library

## 🎨 Architecture Decisions

1. **No ViewModels** - Following CLAUDE.md guidelines, using @Observable and SwiftUI's built-in state management
2. **Flexible data model** - TrainingMethod enum allows different exercise types without optional field explosion
3. **Swift Testing** - Modern testing framework for cleaner syntax
4. **MVP Focus** - Avoiding premature optimization, focusing on core workout creation

## 📝 Example Usage

```swift
// Standard workout
let pushups = Exercise(name: "Push-ups", trainingMethod: .standard(reps: 15))

// Rest-pause (calisthenics style)
let pullups = Exercise(name: "Pull-ups", trainingMethod: .restPause(targetTotal: 50, repRange: "8-12RM"))

// Timed exercise
let plank = Exercise(name: "Plank", trainingMethod: .timed(seconds: 60))

// With tempo
let squats = Exercise(
    name: "Squats", 
    trainingMethod: .standard(reps: 10),
    tempo: Tempo(eccentric: 3, pause: 1, concentric: 1) // 3-1-1 tempo
)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. [ ] Create basic SwiftUI views for workout creation
2. [ ] Implement workout builder interface
3. [ ] Add ability to save/load workouts

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Workout timer/tracking during exercise
- [ ] Exercise library/templates
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Export workouts

## 💡 Key Insights from Development

1. **Rest-pause training** required rethinking the traditional sets/reps model
2. **Swift Testing** is much cleaner than XCTest for new projects
3. **Tempo notation** using "X" for explosive movements is industry standard
4. **76% test coverage** is good enough for MVP - don't over-test

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Swift concurrency warnings when SwiftUI is imported in tests (actor isolation)
- No current bugs in functionality
