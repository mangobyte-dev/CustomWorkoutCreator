# Equatable Implementation Summary

## Phase 1, Step 1.1, Substep 1.1.2: Implementing proper Equatable conformance

### Changes Made:

1. **Workout Model**:
   - Updated Equatable to compare ALL value properties
   - Added comparison of `intervals.count` to detect structural changes
   - This ensures SwiftUI redraws when:
     - Name changes
     - Date/time changes
     - Total duration changes
     - Intervals are added/removed

2. **Interval Model**:
   - Updated Equatable to compare ALL value properties
   - Added comparison of `exercises.count` to detect structural changes
   - This ensures SwiftUI redraws when:
     - Name changes
     - Rounds change
     - Rest periods change
     - Exercises are added/removed

3. **Exercise Model**:
   - Already had comprehensive Equatable implementation
   - Compares all properties including decomposed enum values
   - Updated comment to reflect proper implementation

### Implementation Strategy:

For SwiftData models with relationships:
- We compare all value properties for accurate change detection
- For relationship arrays, we only compare count to detect structural changes
- This avoids expensive deep comparisons while still catching important changes
- This follows the technical guide's recommendation for "efficient SwiftUI diffing"

### Benefits:
- SwiftUI will only redraw views when actual data changes
- Avoids unnecessary redraws when only relationships are loaded/faulted
- Maintains performance while ensuring UI accuracy
- Follows the principle: "Equatable: Detects actual changes to minimize redraws"

### Next Steps:
According to the technical guide, we should now move to:
- Step 1.2: Extract static data and configurations
- Step 1.3: Implement proper caching for expensive computations
