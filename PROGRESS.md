# CustomWorkoutCreator - Progress & Checkpoint

## 🎯 Project Goal
Create a dead-simple, bare-minimum MVP of a custom workout app that lets users create workouts in the structures they prefer. The app should bend to users' will, not force them into rigid structures.

## 📅 Last Updated: July 19, 2025

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Data Models (DataModels.swift)
- [x] **Flexible workout structure** supporting multiple training styles
- [x] **TrainingMethod enum** with associated values:
  - `.standard(minReps: Int, maxReps: Int)` - Rep ranges for progressive overload
  - `.restPause(targetTotal: Int, minReps: Int, maxReps: Int)` - Calisthenics cluster training with rep ranges
  - `.timed(seconds: Int)` - Duration-based exercises
- [x] **Tempo support** for controlled movements (eccentric-pause-concentric notation)
- [x] **Nested structure**: Workout → Intervals → Exercises
- [x] **All models are Codable** for save/load functionality
- [x] **Exercise effort level** (1-10 scale) for intensity tracking
- [x] **Rest after interval** property for custom rest blocks between intervals

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Swift Testing framework (modern approach)
- [x] 76% code coverage on initial tests
- [x] Tests covering:
  - Tempo notation edge cases
  - Different workout type creation
  - Codable serialization
  - Default values and empty states

### 3. SwiftData Persistence Layer
- [x] **Converted all models to @Model classes** for SwiftData compatibility
- [x] **TrainingMethod enum** made SwiftData-compatible with custom Codable implementation
- [x] **WorkoutStore created** with @Observable (not ObservableObject) following CLAUDE.md
- [x] **CRUD operations implemented**:
  - `fetchAllWorkouts()` - Sorted by date (newest first)
  - `addWorkout()` - Insert and save
  - `deleteWorkout()` - Delete with cascade
  - `updateWorkout()` - Save changes
- [x] **SwiftData configuration** in app entry point
- [x] **Cascade delete rules** for proper data cleanup

### 4. Base App Structure
- [x] **Tab-based navigation** with 3 tabs (Home, Workouts, Settings)
- [x] **Minimal views** ready for UI implementation
- [x] **App builds and runs** successfully with persistence

### 5. UI Implementation - CREATE (Phase 1 Complete!)
- [x] **Single-screen workout creation** - Everything happens in one view for efficiency
- [x] **NewWorkoutView** with inline editing:
  - Workout name field
  - Add/remove intervals
  - Expandable/collapsible intervals
  - Inline interval name editing
  - Rounds and rest steppers
  - Rest after interval stepper
- [x] **Inline exercise editing**:
  - Exercise name field
  - Effort level (1-10) stepper
  - Segmented control for training method
  - Rep range steppers for standard exercises
  - Rep range for rest-pause
  - Time stepper for timed exercises
  - Swipe to delete exercises
- [x] **Save functionality**:
  - Creates workout with calculated duration
  - Saves to SwiftData
  - Returns to workout list
- [x] **WorkoutsView** showing saved workouts:
  - Empty state with call to action
  - List of workouts with name, intervals, duration
  - Swipe to delete
  - Auto-refresh after creating workout

## 🚧 Current State

### What's Working
- Full CREATE functionality for workouts
- Flexible data model supporting rep ranges and effort levels
- Single-screen UI for fast workout creation
- Persistence with SwiftData
- Basic workout list with delete functionality
- Duration calculation based on exercise types

### What's Missing
- READ - Detailed workout view (tap to see full workout)
- UPDATE - Edit existing workouts
- Workout timer/tracking during exercise
- Exercise library/templates
- Home view implementation
- Settings view implementation

## 🎨 Architecture Decisions

1. **Single-screen creation** - No sheets or navigation for workout building
2. **Inline editing everywhere** - Direct manipulation without popups
3. **Rep ranges instead of single values** - Better for progressive overload
4. **Effort tracking** - Simple 1-10 scale for each exercise
5. **Rest after interval** - Clean solution for rest blocks between intervals
6. **No ViewModels** - Following CLAUDE.md guidelines
7. **Vanilla SwiftUI only** - No custom design system for MVP

## 📝 Example Usage

```swift
// Standard workout with rep ranges
let pushups = Exercise(
    name: "Push-ups", 
    trainingMethod: .standard(minReps: 12, maxReps: 15),
    effort: 7
)

// Rest-pause with rep ranges
let pullups = Exercise(
    name: "Pull-ups", 
    trainingMethod: .restPause(targetTotal: 50, minReps: 8, maxReps: 12),
    effort: 9
)

// Timed exercise
let plank = Exercise(
    name: "Plank", 
    trainingMethod: .timed(seconds: 60),
    effort: 8
)

// Interval with rest after
let interval = Interval(
    name: "Upper Body",
    exercises: [pushups, pullups],
    rounds: 3,
    restBetweenRounds: 60,
    restAfterInterval: 120  // 2 minute rest before next interval
)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Phase 2 - READ)
1. [ ] Create WorkoutDetailView to show full workout structure
2. [ ] Navigation from list to detail view
3. [ ] Display all intervals, exercises, and rest periods

### Phase 3 - UPDATE
1. [ ] Reuse NewWorkoutView for editing
2. [ ] Pre-populate with existing data
3. [ ] Update save logic to modify existing workout

### Phase 4 - DELETE
1. [x] Swipe to delete in list (already done)
2. [ ] Delete button in edit mode

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Workout timer/tracking during exercise
- [ ] Exercise library/templates
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Export workouts
- [ ] Workout duplication

## 💡 Key Insights from Development

1. **Single-screen UI** dramatically improves workflow efficiency
2. **Rep ranges** are essential for progressive training
3. **Inline editing** reduces cognitive load
4. **Rest after interval** is cleaner than complex ordering systems
5. **Effort tracking** adds valuable context without complexity
6. **Duration estimates** help users plan their time
7. **SwiftData** makes persistence surprisingly simple

## 🐛 Known Issues
- SettingsView has a syntax error (not fixed as it's not priority)
- Duration calculation is an estimate (3 seconds per rep assumption)
