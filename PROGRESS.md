# CustomWorkoutCreator - Progress & Checkpoint

## üéØ Project Goal
Create a dead-simple, bare-minimum MVP of a custom workout app that lets users create workouts in the structures they prefer. The app should bend to users' will, not force them into rigid structures.

## üìÖ Last Updated: July 19, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Data Models (DataModels.swift)
- [x] **Flexible workout structure** supporting multiple training styles
- [x] **TrainingMethod enum** with associated values:
  - `.standard(reps: Int)` - Traditional sets x reps
  - `.restPause(targetTotal: Int, repRange: String?)` - Calisthenics cluster training
  - `.timed(seconds: Int)` - Duration-based exercises
- [x] **Tempo support** for controlled movements (eccentric-pause-concentric notation)
- [x] **Nested structure**: Workout ‚Üí Intervals ‚Üí Exercises
- [x] **All models are Codable** for save/load functionality

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Swift Testing framework (modern approach)
- [x] 76% code coverage on initial tests
- [x] Tests covering:
  - Tempo notation edge cases
  - Different workout type creation
  - Codable serialization
  - Default values and empty states

### 3. SwiftData Persistence Layer
- [x] **Converted all models to @Model classes** for SwiftData compatibility
- [x] **TrainingMethod enum** made SwiftData-compatible with custom Codable implementation
- [x] **WorkoutStore created** with @Observable (not ObservableObject) following CLAUDE.md
- [x] **CRUD operations implemented**:
  - `fetchAllWorkouts()` - Sorted by date (newest first)
  - `addWorkout()` - Insert and save
  - `deleteWorkout()` - Delete with cascade
  - `updateWorkout()` - Save changes
- [x] **SwiftData configuration** in app entry point
- [x] **Cascade delete rules** for proper data cleanup

### 4. Base App Structure
- [x] **Tab-based navigation** with 3 tabs (Home, Workouts, Settings)
- [x] **Minimal views** ready for UI implementation
- [x] **App builds and runs** successfully with persistence

## üöß Current State

### What's Working
- Data models compile and pass all tests
- Flexible enough to handle user's example: "1 circuit of pushups and dips for 4 rounds, then step ups for 5 rounds, then glute bridges for 5 rounds"
- Test infrastructure is set up and running
- SwiftData persistence layer fully implemented
- Tab navigation structure in place
- App builds and runs without errors

### What's Missing
- UI implementation for creating/editing workouts
- Workout timer/tracking during exercise
- Exercise library/templates

## üé® Architecture Decisions

1. **No ViewModels** - Following CLAUDE.md guidelines, using @Observable and SwiftUI's built-in state management
2. **Flexible data model** - TrainingMethod enum allows different exercise types without optional field explosion
3. **Swift Testing** - Modern testing framework for cleaner syntax
4. **MVP Focus** - Avoiding premature optimization, focusing on core workout creation
5. **SwiftData over Core Data** - Modern persistence with less boilerplate
6. **@Observable WorkoutStore** - Not ObservableObject, following performance best practices

## üìù Example Usage

```swift
// Standard workout
let pushups = Exercise(name: "Push-ups", trainingMethod: .standard(reps: 15))

// Rest-pause (calisthenics style)
let pullups = Exercise(name: "Pull-ups", trainingMethod: .restPause(targetTotal: 50, repRange: "8-12RM"))

// Timed exercise
let plank = Exercise(name: "Plank", trainingMethod: .timed(seconds: 60))

// With tempo
let squats = Exercise(
    name: "Squats", 
    trainingMethod: .standard(reps: 10),
    tempo: Tempo(eccentric: 3, pause: 1, concentric: 1) // 3-1-1 tempo
)
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. [ ] Create AddWorkoutView for new workouts
2. [ ] Implement workout list in WorkoutsView
3. [ ] Add interval and exercise editing capabilities

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Workout timer/tracking during exercise
- [ ] Exercise library/templates
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Export workouts

## üí° Key Insights from Development

1. **Rest-pause training** required rethinking the traditional sets/reps model
2. **Swift Testing** is much cleaner than XCTest for new projects
3. **Tempo notation** using "X" for explosive movements is industry standard
4. **76% test coverage** is good enough for MVP - don't over-test
5. **SwiftData enums** with associated values need custom Codable implementation
6. **@Observable + SwiftData** is the modern way - no ViewModels needed
7. **case let syntax** is cleaner for pattern matching in Swift

## üêõ Known Issues
- Swift concurrency warnings when SwiftUI is imported in tests (actor isolation)
- No current bugs in functionality
